## Script Information

- **Name**: Jay Annadurai
- **Title**: DES - Download, Extract, and Summarize
- **Date**: 2 Feb 2024
- **Language**: Shell Script (Bash)
- **Project Version**: 1.0

## Description

"A1 - DES (Download, Extract, Summarize)" is a bash script that automates the process of downloading, extracting, and summarizing secondary human chromosome 1 assemblies from the UCSC Genome Browser. It changes directories, creates a folder, downloads and unzips necessary files, and compiles file information—including names, sizes, permissions, and a preview—into a summary document. This script is designed to streamline data management in bioinformatics projects.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- **UNIX-based System**: This script is designed to run on the bash shell in UNIX-based systems, which include Linux distributions and macOS.
### Software and Libraries

- **wget**: Required for downloading files.
- **gunzip**: Required for extracting `.gz` files.


### Running the Script

1. **Ensure Dependencies**: Confirm `wget` and `gunzip` are installed on your system.
2. **Script Permissions**: Grant execution permissions using `chmod +x scriptname.sh`.
3. **Directory Permissions**: For macOS users or others with directory access restrictions, ensure the script points to a directory where you have write permissions. Edit the script as necessary.
4. **Execution**: Navigate to the script's directory and run `./scriptname.sh`.
5. **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading assembly files.

### Modifications for macOS

If running on macOS and unable to create directories in `/Home`, modify the script to use an accessible directory, such as the Desktop. Adjust the directory path in the script to your preferred location.


### Input Files
- **N/A**: No input files are generated by this script. The necessary data is downloaded directly from the UCSC Genome Browser using the script.

### Important Links

- **UCSC Genome Browser Secondary Assemblies**: A link to the secondary assemblies for human chromosome 1 from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome browser is used. Note that this link may change over time and might not work in the future.



### Output (Generated) Files
- **Informatics_573 Directory**: Hosts downloaded and extracted files.
- **Chromosome 1 Assembly Files**: Secondary human chromosome 1 assemblies are downloaded and extracted into the aforementioned directory.
- **data_summary.txt**: This summary document contains names, sizes, permissions, and previews of the extracted files.
