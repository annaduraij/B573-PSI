Task:
Write a shell script (file extension .sh) that will independently perform the following tasks. The end goal should be that a user could download your script from your repository and be able to successfully run it on any bash compatible computer. Accomplishing this, may require some set up work outside of the terminal, but the end product should be entirely independent.

1. Navigate to the user’s home directory
2. Create a directory titled “Informatics_573” and navigate to it
3. Download all secondary assemblies for human chromosome 1 from University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome browser (all chromosome 1 assemblies except “chr1.fa.gz”)
4. Unzip all of the downloaded chromosome 1 assemblies
5. Create a new empty file called “data_summary.txt”
6. Append a list of the all detailed information (including at least file name, size, and permissions) to “data_summary.txt”
7. Append the first 10 lines of each of the chromosome 1 assemblies to “data_summary.txt”
8. Append the name of assembly as well as the total number of lines included in that assembly to “data_summary.txt”
